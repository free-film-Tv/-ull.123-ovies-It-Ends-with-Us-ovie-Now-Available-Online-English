Dinner and a movie? Chick-fil-A apparently wants to be your one-stop shop. On Aug. 21, Deadline reported that the fast-food chain, known for its chicken sandwiches and Banana Pudding Milkshakes, is launching its own streaming platform along with a slate of original programming. Chick-fil-A has been reportedly working with ‚Äúa number of major production companies‚Äù to create ‚Äúfamily-friendly‚Äù shows, many of which will be reality TV, and is also in talks to license and acquire content. Discussions of scripted content and animation are also apparently on the table.

Deadpool & Wolverine: All the Logan Variants Explained

When it comes to the big screen, there‚Äôs only one Wolverine and his name is Hugh Jackman. After Dougray Scott stuck shooting Mission: Impossible II for longer than anticipated and had to drop out of playing Logan in 2000‚Äôs X-Men, Jackman has owned the part. Not even a noble and beloved death in Logan can put a stop to Jackman‚Äôs reign as cinema‚Äôs premiere Canucklehead, as he dons the goofy mask and yellow duds in full for Deadpool & Wolverine.

But while It Ends with Usdoes further delay the inevitable recasting of Logan for the MCU, it also gives viewers a look at different types of Wolverine. Sure, these are all still Hugh Jackman‚Äîsave, of course, for the one played by Henry Cavill‚Äîbut at least there‚Äôs some more flavor. With that flavor, however, comes some questions, as these variations all come from deep comic book lore. So for anyone who wants to know as much about the alternative Wolverines as Deadpool knows, read on!

Wolvie-Verse Variants Explained!

The most obvious of the bunch is an old codger who Deadpool finds sitting on the porch. With his ragged poncho, brown hat, and weathered face, this Wolverine resembles Clint Eastwood more than he does the yellow-and-blue clad mutant we know and love. That‚Äôs because this is the original Old Man Logan. Where the film adaptation Logan just aged up Jackman a bit, the comics by Mark Millar and Steve McNiven drew inspiration from later Eastwood Westerns such as Unforgiven and Pale Rider, represented by the cowboy look in Deadpool & Wolverine.

Another Wolverine appears against a graffiti-covered wall, decked in a black suit with red highlights. Most notably, this version has only one hand, with a metal stub at the end of the other arm. Technically, that‚Äôs not Wolverine at all‚Äîhe‚Äôs Weapon X, the identity that Logan adopts in the Age of Apocalypse universe. Introduced in a Marvel Comics crossover from 1995, the Age of Apocalypse came about when Charles Xavier‚Äôs son Legion accidentally Deadpool & Wolverines his father before the formation of the X-Men, creating an alternate reality ruled by Apocalypse.

A differnt Wolvie appears in a fancy white suit with a patch over his eye, playing cards with other figures of ill-repute. By design he looks a bit like Adolfo Celi‚Äôs Largo in the classic Bond movie Thunderball (1965), but as Deadpool rightly notes, this version of Logan is called ‚ÄúPatch.‚Äù In the comics, Patch isn‚Äôt from an alternate reality; he‚Äôs an alias that Wolverine sometimes takes on when hiding out in Madripoor, a fictional East Asian country that has made one MCU appearance in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.

As much as Deadpool boasts his comic knowledge in these sequences, he does get one wrong when he arrives in snowy wilderness to find Wolverine unmasked yet wearing a brown and yellow costume. Deadpool attributes the look to John Byrne, the artist and co-writer who made some of the best X-Men comics, alongside Chris Claremont. But when Deadpool realizes that Logan‚Äôs about to throw down with the Hulk, Wolvie pops his claws, showing a reflection of the unjolly Jade Giant across the adamantium. That shot references the cover of 1987‚Äôs Incredible Hulk #340, drawn not by Byrne, but by Todd McFarlane.

Speaking of iconic covers, Deadpool arrives in a foggy purple world and finds Wolverine nailed to an X-shaped cross above a pile of skulls. That shot recreates (via ugly digital effects) Marc Silvestri‚Äôs cover to Uncanny X-Men #251 from 1989, in which Donald Pierce and the Reavers (the bad guys in Logan) capture Wolverine and put him on that X in the Australian sun.

At this point, a persnickety person might point out that all of these comic book nods feature Hugh Jackman. Jackman is tall, Australian, mostly hairless, and a far cry from the short, hairy, Canadian that is the comic book accurate Wolverine. Well, don‚Äôt fear, because that‚Äôs just what Deadpool finds when he visits yet another universe!

Deadpool tells this Wolverine about his plight, and for once a new Logan answers in the affirmative, hopping off the stool and ready for action. In doing so, the Wolverine reveals that he‚Äôs quite hairy and quite short (looking more like Puck from Alpha Flight than Wolverine‚Äôs canonical 5‚Äô3‚Äù, but still). Like so many shallow people, Deadpool can‚Äôt get over the height thing and leaves comics accurate Wolvie behind. His loss. (Why yes, this article i‚Äôs written by a very short man. How could you tell?)

As much fun as these deep comic book dives certainly are, it would be nice if we could move on from Jackman‚Äôs take and see another actor‚Äôs interpretation make it to screen. Because if these cameos prove anything, it‚Äôs that there‚Äôs a lot more to Wolverine than even an actor as talented as Jackman has explored. Although seeing Cavill show up in a gag at the DC franchise‚Äôs expense was a pretty good start‚Ä¶

Is 'Deadpool & Wolverine' Streaming? Where To Watch Marvel's Ambitious Summer Blockbuster. The biggest movie of the Summer is almost here, with It Ends with Usset to bring two of Marvel's biggest icons to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A first of its kind for Marvel Studios, the R-rated comedy will bring Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) and Logan Howlett (Hugh Jackman) to the MCU, with the two sharing the screen for the first time ever. Yep. First time ever. They definitely haven't met before in a movie called X-Men Origins: Wolverine. That'd be wacky.

At the end of Deadpool & Wolverine, Wade plays around with time to revive his beloved girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and his X-Force teammates. However, what Wade didn't expect was to get the attention of the Time Variance Authority (first seen in Disney+'s Loki), and they recruited both him and a particularly depressed Wolverine to save the multiverse from Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin). Marvel hasn't had a multiversal event this big since Spider-Man: No Way Home, so you better believe Marvel fans across the globe are primed and ready to see their favorite mutants return to the screen. To find out when and how you can watch this chimichanga-filled buddy cop adventure, here is where you can watch Deadpool & Wolverine.

Is 'Deadpool & Wolverine' Streaming?

No, It Ends with Usis not currently available to stream. At least, not yet. As soon as Wade and Logan are finishing their slashing spree on the big screen, the film will more than likely follow suit with the other MCU projects and X-Men and become available to stream on Disney+. However, since It Ends with Usis Marvel Studios' first-ever R-rated feature, there is a decent chance that the movie could be released simultaneously on Hulu. A simultaneous release on Disney+ and Hulu is what Marvel Studios decided to do with their first TV-MA-rated series, Echo.

What Is the Release Date for 'Deadpool & Wolverine'?

Wade and Logan's quest to save the multiverse begins when It Ends with Usofficially premieres in the United States and Canada on Friday, July 26, 2024. However, some parts of the globe will get to see this historic anti-hero union a few days earlier, depending on which country you call home.

Is 'Deadpool & Wolverine' in Theaters?

Yes, It Ends with Uswill be a big-screen adventure well-suited for two of Marvel's most beloved characters. The hugely anticipated team-up won't have to tangle with too much competition that weekend, though the disaster film sequel It Ends with Usdid storm into theaters a week earlier. The week after Deadpool & Wolverine, the film will then be sharing theater space with M. Night Shyamalan's new thriller Deadpool & Wolverine, Colman Domingo's Oscar hopeful Sing Sing, and Zachary Levi's children's book adaptation Deadpool & Wolverine.

The release of It Ends with Usmay be just around the corner, but Marvel dropped one more special look at the upcoming film just a week before the big premiere day. Apart from a quick reference to Spider-Man at the end, the final trailer is a big departure from the previous trailers by focusing much more on the emotional core of both Deadpool & Wolverine. However, that's not why this trailer has gotten people talking. Not only does it give us a proper look at Lady It Ends with Us(who is rumored to be played by Ryan Reynolds' real-life wife Blake Lively), but the trailer confirms that Dafne Keen will indeed be reprising her role as Logan's surrogate daughter, X-23, last seen in the film Logan.

In Disney‚Äôs Deadpool & Wolverine, Riley Anderson (Tallman) is now a full-fledged teenager embarking on the wild ride of puberty and unfamiliar social scenes at her new school.
